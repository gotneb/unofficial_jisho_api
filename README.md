# About
I'm really excited about Rust and really enjoying programming on it.
That's also my first time uploading and contributing to the community.

If you have any improvements please submit a pull request. I'll be glad learning and getting in touch with other developers.

## Running
You must have chromedriver running in your machine.

You can use chromedriver directly by downloading the chromedriver that matches your Chrome version, from here: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

Then run it like this:

```
chromedriver --port=4444
```
